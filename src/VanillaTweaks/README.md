### Vanilla Tweaks

Various small changes to make some vanilla stuff more interesting.

#### Stuff changed

**Oni Spirit Bomb:**

secondary hit is based on damage dealt by the first one. Tooltip fixed to report accurate damage. 
This means that player damage modifiers are effectively applied twice to the secondary hit. 
Sometimes, with enough damage multipliers secondary damage can exceed primary.

**Fairies' Abode:**

triggers when skill enters the hand by any means, not only when it was created.
