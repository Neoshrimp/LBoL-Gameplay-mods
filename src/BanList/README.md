### Ban List

Prevents certain cards from being found/created or from being upgraded.

Banlist is customizable via `BanList.yaml`. The file should contain card one card id per line prefixed with `    - ` . Card name to id mapping can be found at `<GameDirectory>\LBoL_Data\StreamingAssets\Localization\en\Cards.yaml`. After modifying `BanList.yaml`, run the game and check `<GameDirectory>\BepInEx\LogOutput.log` for any potential yaml errors.

_MoonWorld is id of Filthless World_
